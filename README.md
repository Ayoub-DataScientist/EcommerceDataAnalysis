# EcommerceDataAnalysis

Welcome to the EcommerceDataAnalysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce company's dataset using SQL queries and visualizations to derive insights and provide actionable recommendations for marketing and inventory strategies.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the provided dataset from an e-commerce company and gain meaningful insights that can drive business growth. By leveraging SQL queries and visualizations, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities within the data to make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis consists of the following tables:

- `Customers`: Contains customer information such as customer_id, name, email, and location.
- `Orders`: Contains order details such as order_id, customer_id, order_date, and total_amount.
- `Products`: Contains product information such as product_id, name, price, and category.

## Analysis Queries

The following SQL queries have been used to perform data analysis on the dataset:

1. **Query: Calculate the total revenue generated by the company**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
   FROM Orders;
   
2. **Query: Find the top 5 customers who have made the highest number of orders**
    ```sql
   SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
   FROM Customers c
   INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
   ORDER BY order_count DESC
   LIMIT 5;

3. **Query: Retrieve the most popular product categories based on the number of orders**
    ```sql
    SELECT p.category, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
    FROM Products p
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
    GROUP BY p.category
    ORDER BY order_count DESC;
4. **Query: Calculate the average order value**
```sql
     SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_order_value
     FROM Orders;
